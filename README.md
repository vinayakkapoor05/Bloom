# Bloom - A Bacteria Ecosystem Game

Bloom is a dynamic, action-packed game where you protect blue consumer bacteria from hungry red predators, manage nutrient collection, and strategically deploy powerful abilities to survive waves of enemies.

## Game Overview
In Bloom, you are tasked with keeping your consumer bacteria safe in a petri dish arena. The blue consumer bacteria regenerate health over time, but if they are destroyed, the game ends. You need to manage resources, collect nutrients, and use your abilities to fend off increasingly difficult waves of red predators.

## Objective
Survive for 5 minutes and outlast all waves of predators while keeping the consumer bacteria alive.

## Gameplay Features

### Game Elements:
- **Consumer Bacteria (Blue)**: These are the bacteria you need to protect. They slowly regenerate health, but if all are destroyed, you lose.
- **Producer Bacteria (Green)**: These bacteria regularly shoot out nutrients that you can collect to power your abilities.
- **Predators (Red)**: The enemies! These predators arrive in waves and will try to destroy your consumer bacteria.
- **Nutrients**: Produced by the green bacteria, these are essential for using abilities like spore projectiles and enzyme bombs.

### Abilities:
- **Spore Projectile**: A nutrient-powered projectile that damages predators on contact.
  - **Cost**: 1 nutrient per shot.
  - **Controls**: Left-click to shoot. Use your mouse or trackpad to aim.
  
- **Enzyme Bomb**: A powerful bomb that damages all predators within its blast radius.
  - **Cost**: Requires 10 nutrients to deploy.
  - **Controls**: Press Spacebar to deploy.

## Controls
- **Movement**: WASD or Arrow keys to move around the petri dish.
- **Aiming**: Use your mouse or trackpad to aim.
- **Spore Projectile**: Left-click to shoot in the direction you aim.
- **Enzyme Bomb**: Press Spacebar to drop an enzyme bomb.

## How to Play
1. **Collect Nutrients**: Gather nutrients from the green producer bacteria. Nutrients are necessary to use your abilities (spore projectiles and enzyme bombs).
2. **Use Abilities Wisely**: Use enzyme bombs when large groups of predators approach the consumer bacteria. Be strategic with your spore projectiles to avoid running out of nutrients.
3. **Survive Waves**: Each wave of predators gets harder, so prepare your defenses accordingly. If the consumer bacteria are destroyed, the game ends.

## Winning & Losing
- **Win**: Survive for 5 minutes and outlast all predator waves.
- **Lose**: The game ends if all consumer bacteria are destroyed.

## Tips
- **Collect Nutrients Between Waves**: Use the time between predator waves to gather as many nutrients as possible.
- **Conserve Resources**: Use your abilities strategically to avoid running out of nutrients too quickly. Use enzyme bombs when large groups of predators are near consumer bacteria.
- **Keep Consumers Alive**: Prioritize keeping predators away from the consumer bacteria to avoid losing the game.
